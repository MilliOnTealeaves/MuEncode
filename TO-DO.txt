Definitely:
- Letter/character shift (should be pretty easy?
	foreach loop with chararray or someting?
- Drag-drop file into input
- Save output as file
	- save location
	- making sure i don't overwrite existing files
		random-generated filename
		date-time-based filename




Maybe:
- Write to .wav files (properly this time)
